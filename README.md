# Open Metadata on Scholarly Communication 



This is a repository of some of the projects I am currently working on in the area of **Open Metadata on Scholarly Communication**. 

The repository is a working area sharing scripts, reading notes , links to resources and early drafts to documentations. 


### FOCUS 

*Open Metadata on Scholarly Communication* are useful in a variety of contexts. 

Here the (initial) focus will be mainly on the use/potential of open metadata for 

- the study of science. [**Scientometrics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientometrics), *the quantitative study of science, technology, and innovation* // [**Metascience**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metascience) *,the use of scientific methodology to study science itself*.


- Monitoring and Evaluation of research funding programs
